## Swift Solvers Internship (Data Science)
### By Aimen Imran

This repository consists of 5 tasks that were assigned by Swift Solvers as a part of their October Phase 1 Internship Program in Data Science.

The tasks are as follows:

### Task 1: IRIS Flower Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Assuming that I have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, I have trained a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.


### Task 2: Unemployement Analysis with Python

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so I have analyzed the unemployment rate using Data Science techniques in Python.


### Task 3: Car price prediction with Machine Learning

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So in this project, I have trained a car price prediction model in Python using Data Science techniques.


### Task 4: Email spam detection with Machine Learning

Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project, I have used Python to build an email spam detector. Then, used machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.


### Task 5: Sales prediction using Python

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So I have performed the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
